FOX HUNT

You're an intergalactic fox just trying to survive day to day by gathering food and supplies for
your family. Unfortunately, you live in a dangerous quadrant of space occupied by the ruthless,
invasive civilisation known as the Hunters - stay safe, stay alive!

The project is written in C++ using SDL2. The basic structure of the game engine has been built
by following (and extending) the textbook exercises from C++ Game Programming by Sanjay Madhav.

The game code, art and design are all original.
